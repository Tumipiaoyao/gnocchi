The Killer of English Words Examination--Baicizhan
With the procedure of globalization，the international communication became more and more important.Because of the strong influence of those English-speaking countries,English became the language of the whole world and English learning has been the central education issue of many non-English speaking countries.Though Chinese may win the edge of others,but the vocabulary is always a big problem to all the English learns.As one of the English learners,I also tried many ways to memorizing new words,less of them works efficiently,until I met this “killer of English words examination”--Baicizhan.
Baicizhan is a software developed by Chaoyouai Limited Liability Company.It contains the vocabulary from junior school to TOEFL、GMAT 、GRE and so on.Users can choose any of list and make their own plan about remembering how many words each day.According to users’ own plan,it will show you the words the users learned the day before to strengthen the impression of those words.Then,it will give the words which belongs to the task of today. 
This software uses a different way from other traditional ways to help users to memorize English words.It gave every word a picture which is relevant to its meaning,so users can remember the word’s meaning vividly.This way is also used in memorizing the spelling of the words. When remembering new words,it will show the spelling of them , a sentence with these words and four pictures.The users need to guess the meaning of the word according to the sentence and choose one given picture which may stands for that meaning.If the choice is right,it will show you more about this word，for instance,phonetic symbol,sentences,meanings and so on.After looking through all these,uesers have two choices to deal with this word:"pass" or "cut" it."Pass" means users remember the word for this time.Next time when users review the words,the words you choose to pass will show up again.While "cut" means that users have known all the meanings、usages and spelling of the word,so this word will not show up for reviewing again.Baicizhan has some other useful functions as well,for instance,dictation,test for vocabulary.After finishing the vocabulary test,this software will draw a line chart about your progress of vocabulary weekly.
Though using Baicizhan can fasten the speed of memorizing words,this software still has some defects.The first one is the picture which is bonded to the word can only show one meaning,but usually a word can has many different meanings which may be totally irrelevant to others sometimes.In this situation,users can remember one meaning quickly,but spend much time in remembering others if they want to fully understand this word.The second is though the pictures and images help the users to memorizing quickly,sometimes too quick to remember accurately so that users find that when encountering  this word again,they can only think of  the picture but not the exact meaning of it.
Baicizhan is an developing software,I hope it can stress its merits and decrease its defects to help users better.Also I want to stress that English learning can’t rely on a software only.If learners can’t be autonomic or they just focus on vocabulary,they will never learn English well.
